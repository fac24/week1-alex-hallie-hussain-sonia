# bl√∏gge: a microblogging website

## Summary

Made for the [Week I project](https://learn.foundersandcoders.com/course/syllabus/apprenticeship/server/project/) of the Founders and Coders full-time apprencticeship, a microblogging website made without HTML. 

## How To Install

- Clone repository
- Make sure Node and npm are installed
- Command line: npm run dev

## User Stories

- As an opinionated person, I want to: post my thoughts so others can read them
- As a bored person, I want to: read what other people have posted 
- As an impulsive person, I want to: delete my posts so no one can see them anymore

## User Journey

1. The user lands on the page
2. The user sees a range of sample posts
3. The user enters their name, writes a thought and clicks submit
4. The user sees their post join the other posts
5. The user is consumed by regret and deletes their post
6. The user chooses to finish what they have begun and deletes the posts of others

## Requirements

- [x] A page with a form to submit posts, and a page showing all posts [functionality achieved on one page]
- [x] No .html files (all HTML responses should be created dynamically within Node)
- [x] No client-side JavaScript (all logic should happen on the server)
- [ ] All static assets served correctly (CSS, favicon etc)
- [x] Tests for each server route
- [x] A responsive, mobile-first design
- [ ] Ensure your app is accessible to as many different users as possible

## Further Steps

- We considered adding a date-time stamp to the posts, following an example from fac-23
- Make the layout more responsive and mobile-friendly
- More accessibility testing would have been good
- Have more recent posts appear above older ones
